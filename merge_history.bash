# merge_history.bash: merge bash history lines just like zsh merge_history
# by pts@fazekas.hu at Fri Mar 25 15:14:43 CET 2011
#
# * tested with bash 4.1.5 (on Ubuntu Lucid)
# * based on http://hints.macworld.com/dlfiles/preexec.bash.txt
# * based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/103944/
#
# Installation:
#
# * Copy this file to ~/merge_history.bash .
# * Run this: touch ~/.merged_bash_history
# * Put (append) this to your ~/.bashrc: source "$HOME"/merge_history.bash
# * Set HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE to large enough values in your ~/.bashrc .
# * Close all your terminal windows (and SSH connections) and open new ones
#   to make the changes take effect.
# * If you want your old shell history to be reused, please copy
#   ~/.bash_history to ~/.merged_bash_history .
#
# zsh equivalent of this command:
#
#   setopt hist_ignore_dups share_history inc_append_history extended_history
#
# It's safe to reload this file by `source'-ing it to an existing bash.
#
# TODO(pts): Add support for multiline commands.
